            >We are the Plasticity Lab, led by Prof Rumeysa Eser. We study the
            extent to which brain areas supporting perception and action are
            shaped by experience. Our research focuses on hand representation
            and how it is modulated by hand loss and consequential compensatory
            behaviour. We aim to develop a mechanistic understanding of the
            neural basis of hand function and dysfunction, and understand how we
            could use technology to increase hand functionality in able and
            disabled individuals at all ages.</small

          <small
            >In particular, we want to know what happens to the cortical
            territories of the hand following arm amputation, and understand how
            the brain best supports the acquisition of new skills necessary for
            amputees to adapt to their disability, including prosthetic limb
            usage and augmentative technology such as the Third Thumb. We are
            also interested in further understanding why amputees experience
            vivid sensations of their missing hand many decades after
            amputation. To understand these processes better, we combine
            experimental models, performed on healthy participants, and related
            clinical populations (e.g. individuals with congenital hand loss and
            the blind). Our research seeks to define the boundaries of
            plasticity - our brain's ability to adapt how it processes inputs
            based on changed experience.</small
