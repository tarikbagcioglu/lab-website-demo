        <h5>Postdoctoral Research Associate</h5>
        <p>
          The Plasticity Lab is currently seeking a dedicated Postdoctoral
          Research Associate for a two-year fixed-term position in the first
          place, with the possibility of extension. Join our cutting-edge
          research program, spearheaded by Prof. Rumeysa Eser, as we delve into
          the fascinating realms of motor control, neural representation of the
          human body, and robotic body augmentation technology. Applications are
          now live on the <a class="secondary" target="_blank" href="https://careersearch.stanford.edu"
          >University of Stanford website</a
        >.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a vital member of our team, you will be responsible for joining an
          innovative research program aligned with the <a class="secondary" target="_blank" href="./index.html">Plasticity Lab's core
            interests</a>. Your tasks will include data collection, analysis,
          write-up, and dissemination of ongoing and future research.
          Furthermore, you will play a crucial role in supporting and training
          PhD students and other lab members in advanced analysis techniques.
          The ideal candidate will possess expertise in sensorimotor control,
          motor learning, or sensory/motor brain plasticity of humans.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are relatively open-minded regarding the set of skills that the
          candidate will bring with them, however, candidates must have
          experience in designing, running, and analysing human studies.
        </p>
        <p>
          A typical candidates should have either advanced fMRI or MEG expertise
          (e.g. multivariate analysis, laminar 7T), or alternatively an
          impressive background in quantitative (computational) motor control,
          or expertise with wearable motor technologies. Experience testing
          clinical populations with motor control challenges (children, stroke
          patients) is desirable.
